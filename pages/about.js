        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Ryan Bradley is a dedicated public servant, father of four, military veteran, and a mental health provider who’s committed his life to service and pragmatic problem-solving.

        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          As a doctorally trained psychiatric Physician Assistant, Ryan founded Dragonfly Behavioral Health Services, where he provides care across the lifespan and focuses on treatment-resistant depression, neurodevelopmental disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and veterans' mental health.

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Ryan is not a career politician. He believes in deliberate, methodical, and transparent leadership — putting people over politics and solutions over soundbites. He’s running for Congress to address real issues affecting real people: cost of living, school overcrowding, infrastructure, and access to affordable, quality healthcare.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Ryan and his family live in Northwest Florida where they’re deeply rooted in their community, school life, and local faith traditions.
